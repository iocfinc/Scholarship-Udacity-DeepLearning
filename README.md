# Scholarship-Udacity-DeepLearning

This is going to be the main repository that I have for most of the items or projects I would be doing in my Deep Learning with PyTorch Nanodegree. I am doing some logs on what I accomplish each day through out the course so this should be where I can look back and see my progress.
